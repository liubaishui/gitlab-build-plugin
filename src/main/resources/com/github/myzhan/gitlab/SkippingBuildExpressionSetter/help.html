    Normally, Gitlab Build Plugin triggers a build, when it receives a webhook. You can change this default behavior,
    by setting a skipping build expression, that is a groovy expression.

    <p>
    Once the expression returns true, no build will be triggered, and current webhook will be just ignored.

    <p>
    The some variables are predefined, GITLAB_* parameters and build parameters. If you want to ignore tag push event,
    write a expression like this.

    <p>
    GITLAB_OBJECT_KIND == "tag_push"
